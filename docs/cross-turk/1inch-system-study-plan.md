# 1inch Fusion+ System Study Plan

> **Purpose**: Understand the existing 1inch Fusion+ system before integrating with our ICP Mechanical Turk
> **Goal**: Learn the interfaces, data structures, and workflows to build compatible ICP components
> **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks of focused study before implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Study Areas**

### **1. Contract Architecture & Interfaces**

#### **A. EscrowFactory Interface**

```solidity
// Key methods to understand:
interface IEscrowFactory {
    function createDstEscrow(IBaseEscrow.Immutables calldata dstImmutables, uint256 srcCancellationTimestamp) external payable;
    function addressOfEscrowSrc(IBaseEscrow.Immutables calldata immutables) external view returns (address);
    function addressOfEscrowDst(IBaseEscrow.Immutables calldata immutables) external view returns (address);
}
```

**Study Tasks:**

- [ ] Understand `IBaseEscrow.Immutables` structure
- [ ] Learn factory pattern and deterministic address computation
- [ ] Study safety deposit requirements
- [ ] Understand timelock mechanisms

#### **B. Base Escrow Interface**

```solidity
interface IBaseEscrow {
    struct Immutables {
        bytes32 orderHash;
        bytes32 hashlock;  // Hash of the secret
        Address maker;
        Address taker;
        Address token;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 safetyDeposit;
        Timelocks timelocks;
    }

    function withdraw(bytes32 secret, Immutables calldata immutables) external;
    function cancel(Immutables calldata immutables) external;
    function rescueFunds(address token, uint256 amount, Immutables calldata immutables) external;
}
```

**Study Tasks:**

- [ ] Understand withdrawal mechanism with secret
- [ ] Learn cancellation logic and timelocks
- [ ] Study rescue funds functionality
- [ ] Understand event emission patterns

### **2. Limit Order Protocol Integration**

#### **A. EIP-712 Order Structure**

```solidity
struct Order {
    uint256 salt;
    Address maker;
    Address receiver;
    Address makerAsset;
    Address takerAsset;
    uint256 makingAmount;
    uint256 takingAmount;
    MakerTraits makerTraits;
}
```

**Study Tasks:**

- [ ] Learn EIP-712 signing process
- [ ] Understand order validation
- [ ] Study extension data (hashlock, timelocks)
- [ ] Learn postInteraction callback mechanism

#### **B. Order Execution Flow**

```
1. Maker signs EIP-712 order (off-chain)
2. Resolver calls fillOrder() with extension data
3. LOP validates order and calls postInteraction
4. postInteraction creates EscrowSrc
5. Resolver creates EscrowDst manually
6. Maker reveals secret to resolver
7. Resolver withdraws from both escrows
```

**Study Tasks:**

- [ ] Trace complete order execution flow
- [ ] Understand extension data encoding
- [ ] Learn postInteraction callback timing
- [ ] Study cross-chain coordination

### **3. Data Structures & Types**

#### **A. Timelocks Structure**

```solidity
struct Timelocks {
    uint32 srcWithdrawal;
    uint32 srcPublicWithdrawal;
    uint32 srcCancellation;
    uint32 srcPublicCancellation;
    uint32 dstWithdrawal;
    uint32 dstPublicWithdrawal;
    uint32 dstCancellation;
    uint32 dstPublicCancellation;
}
```

**Study Tasks:**

- [ ] Understand each timelock period
- [ ] Learn withdrawal vs cancellation logic
- [ ] Study public vs private periods
- [ ] Understand time-based security

#### **B. Address & Token Handling**

```solidity
struct Address {
    uint256 chainId;
    address addr;
}
```

**Study Tasks:**

- [ ] Learn cross-chain address representation
- [ ] Understand chain ID handling
- [ ] Study token address validation
- [ ] Learn multi-chain token support

### **4. Security Mechanisms**

- [ ] Study safety deposit requirements
- [ ] Understand economic security model
- [ ] Learn deposit calculation logic
- [ ] Study refund mechanisms

#### **B. Hashlock & Secret Management**

- [ ] Understand hashlock computation
- [ ] Learn secret revelation timing
- [ ] Study secret validation
- [ ] Understand replay protection

#### **C. Whitelisting & Access Control**

- [ ] Study resolver whitelisting
- [ ] Learn access control patterns
- [ ] Understand permission management
- [ ] Study upgrade mechanisms
