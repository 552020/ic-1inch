# Requirements Analysis

_Detailed breakdown of the "Extend Fusion+ to ICP" challenge requirements_

---

## Qualification Requirements

### **1. Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation**

#### **Where this will be coded:**

- **ICP Escrow Canisters** - Our Rust implementation
- **Hashlock:** Secret verification mechanism in our escrow canisters
- **Timelock:** Time-based access control in our escrow canisters

#### **What this means:**

- **Hashlock:** User generates secret â†’ hash â†’ both escrows verify secret matches hash
- **Timelock:** Different time windows for withdrawal, cancellation, recovery
- **Implementation:** Follow same patterns as 1inch EVM contracts but in Rust

### **2. Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)**

#### **Is this an extra module or clarification of point 1?**

**This is a clarification of the complete functionality** - not an extra module.

#### **What bidirectional means:**

- **ICP â†’ ETH:** ICP user wants ETH tokens
- **ETH â†’ ICP:** ETH user wants ICP tokens

#### **Do we need to implement ETH/EVM part?**

**NO!** Users communicate the same way regardless of direction:

#### **User Flow (Both Directions):**

```
ICP User wants ETH:
1. ICP user â†’ Frontend â†’ 1inch API â†’ Resolver â†’ ETH escrow + ICP escrow

ETH User wants ICP:
1. ETH user â†’ Frontend â†’ 1inch API â†’ Resolver â†’ ETH escrow + ICP escrow
```

**The same architecture works for both directions** - we just need to ensure our ICP escrows can handle both scenarios.

### **3. Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo**

#### **What this means exactly:**

- **Real token transfers** on actual blockchains (not simulations)
- **Testnet is acceptable** (Sepolia for ETH, ICP testnet)
- **Must show actual tokens moving** between chains
- **Live demonstration** of the complete swap flow

#### **Demo Requirements:**

- **ICP Testnet:** Deploy our escrow canisters
- **Ethereum Sepolia:** Use existing 1inch escrow contracts
- **Real Tokens:** Transfer actual testnet tokens
- **Complete Flow:** User â†’ Resolver â†’ Atomic Swap â†’ Success

## Stretch Goals Analysis

### **MVP Without Stretch Goals**

#### **Core MVP (Qualification Requirements Only):**

- **ICP Escrow Canisters** (hashlock + timelock)
- **Cross-chain communication** (HTTP outcalls)
- **Integration with 1inch APIs**
- **Bidirectional swap functionality**
- **Live demo with real token transfers**

#### **What "No UI" means:**

- **Direct canister interaction** via dfx commands
- **API calls** via curl/Postman
- **Command-line interface** for testing
- **No web frontend** required

#### **MVP User Flow:**

```
1. User calls ICP canister directly (dfx call)
2. Canister communicates with 1inch APIs
3. Resolver executes swap via existing Ethereum contracts
4. User verifies success via canister queries
```

### **Stretch Goal 1: UI**

#### **What this adds:**

- **Web frontend** for user interaction
- **Wallet integration** (Plug wallet for ICP, MetaMask for ETH)
- **Order management interface**
- **Swap status tracking**
- **User-friendly experience**

#### **Implementation:**

- **React/Next.js frontend**
- **Connect to our ICP canisters**
- **Integrate with 1inch Fusion+ APIs**
- **Wallet connection for both chains**

### **Stretch Goal 2: Enable Partial Fills**

#### **What this means:**

- **Order splitting** into multiple parts
- **Multiple resolvers** can fill parts of same order
- **Merkle tree secrets** for progressive fills
- **Complex secret management**

#### **Implementation:**

- **Merkle tree logic** in our ICP canisters
- **Indexed secrets** for different fill percentages
- **Progressive withdrawal** mechanisms
- **Multiple resolver coordination**

### **Stretch Goal 3: Relayer and Resolver**

#### **What this means:**

- **Relayer:** Service that manages cross-chain communication
- **Resolver:** Professional entity that executes swaps
- **Infrastructure** for production deployment

#### **What is a Relayer?**

A **relayer** is a backend service that acts as an intermediary in the Fusion+ protocol:

**Functions:**

- **Order Broadcasting** - Distributes user orders to the resolver network
- **Cross-Chain Coordination** - Manages communication between Ethereum and ICP
- **State Synchronization** - Ensures both chains have consistent swap state
- **Event Monitoring** - Watches for events on both chains and updates status
- **Error Handling** - Manages failed transactions and recovery

**Example:**

```
User â†’ Relayer â†’ Resolver Network
Relayer monitors Ethereum events â†’ Updates ICP state
Relayer monitors ICP events â†’ Updates Ethereum state
```

#### **What is a Resolver?**

A **resolver** is a professional entity (usually automated) that executes swaps:

**Functions:**

- **Order Monitoring** - Watches for new swap orders
- **Liquidity Provision** - Provides tokens for swaps
- **Transaction Execution** - Submits transactions on both chains
- **Secret Management** - Handles the hashlock secrets
- **Gas Management** - Pays for transaction fees

**Example:**

```
Resolver sees order: "Swap 100 ICP for 0.1 ETH"
Resolver deposits 0.1 ETH in Ethereum escrow
Resolver deposits 100 ICP in ICP escrow
Resolver reveals secret to complete swap
```

#### **Why MVP Works Without Them:**

**âœ… Manual Operation:**

- **Manual Order Submission** - We submit orders directly via 1inch APIs
- **Manual Cross-Chain Coordination** - We manually verify events on both chains
- **Manual Resolver Role** - We act as the resolver manually
- **Manual Secret Management** - We handle secrets manually

**âœ… MVP Demo Flow:**

```
1. We submit order via 1inch API (manual)
2. We monitor order status (manual)
3. We execute swap transactions (manual)
4. We verify completion (manual)
```

#### **Why Relayer/Resolver Are Needed for Production:**

**ðŸš€ Production Requirements:**

- **24/7 Operation** - Automated monitoring and execution
- **Multiple Users** - Handle many concurrent swaps
- **Professional Liquidity** - Large token pools for instant swaps
- **Error Recovery** - Automatic handling of failed transactions
- **Scalability** - Handle high transaction volumes

**ðŸš€ Production Flow:**

```
User submits order â†’ Relayer broadcasts â†’ Multiple resolvers compete
Resolver wins â†’ Relayer coordinates â†’ Automated execution
Relayer monitors â†’ Automatic completion â†’ User gets tokens
```

#### **Implementation:**

- **Relayer service** (backend API) - Node.js/Python service
- **Resolver bot** (automated swap execution) - Automated trading bot
- **Monitoring and alerting** - Dashboard and notifications
- **Production infrastructure** - Cloud deployment and scaling

#### **MVP vs Production:**

| Aspect               | MVP (Manual)        | Production (Automated)       |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Order Submission** | Manual API calls    | Automated relayer            |
| **Execution**        | Manual transactions | Automated resolver bot       |
| **Monitoring**       | Manual checking     | Automated monitoring         |
| **Users**            | Demo only           | Multiple concurrent users    |
| **Liquidity**        | Our own tokens      | Professional liquidity pools |
| **Availability**     | Demo time only      | 24/7 operation               |

**âœ… Conclusion:** Our MVP works perfectly without relayers and resolvers because we can manually perform all the functions that would be automated in production. This is exactly how you'd test and validate the core functionality before building the production infrastructure.

## Critical ICP vs Ethereum Differences

### **Smart Contract Immutability vs Canister Upgradability**

**Challenge:** ICP canisters are mutable by default, creating rug-pull risks that don't exist on Ethereum.

**Ethereum Reality:**

- Smart contracts are **immutable by default**
- Once deployed, code cannot be changed
- Security through immutability is guaranteed

**ICP Reality:**

- Canisters are **mutable by default**
- Controllers can upgrade code at any time
- **Rug-pull risk** - malicious upgrades can steal funds
- Must **explicitly make immutable** for security

**Impact on Requirements:**

- Canister immutability for production deployment
- Governance options (immutable vs DAO-controlled)
- Transparency and verifiability requirements

### **Code Verification and Reproducibility**

**Challenge:** ICP lacks built-in source verification like Etherscan.

**Ethereum Reality:**

- **Source code verification** on Etherscan
- **Bytecode matching** - deployed code matches verified source
- **Transparent verification** - anyone can verify contract code

**ICP Reality:**

- **No built-in source verification** like Etherscan
- **Reproducible builds** must be manually implemented
- **Trust through transparency** - must provide open source + reproducible builds
- **Manual verification process** - users must verify themselves

**Impact on Requirements:**

- Open source and reproducible builds
- Trust model transparency and documentation

### **Economic Model (Gas vs Cycles)**

**Challenge:** ICP's reverse gas model fundamentally changes cost structure and security considerations.

**Ethereum Reality:**

- **Users pay gas** for transactions
- **Gas costs visible** to users
- **Predictable costs** based on operation complexity

**ICP Reality:**

- **Developers pay cycles** for execution
- **Users don't pay** for transactions
- **Cycle costs hidden** from users
- **DoS risk** - malicious users can drain developer cycles

**Impact on Requirements:**

- Cycle management and DoS protection
- User education about economic model differences

### **Cross-Chain Communication**

**Challenge:** ICP's HTTP outcalls require trust in RPC providers, unlike Ethereum's direct integration.

**Ethereum Reality:**

- **Direct integration** with other chains (like Bitcoin on ICP)
- **Trustless verification** through cryptographic proofs
- **No RPC provider trust** required

**ICP Reality:**

- **HTTP outcalls** to external RPC providers
- **Trust required** - users must trust RPC providers
- **Consensus model** - subnet nodes must agree on responses
- **Provider disagreements** can cause failures

**Impact on Requirements:**

- Trust assumptions documentation
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### **Timelock Automation**

**Opportunity:** ICP's canister timers provide unique automation capabilities.

**Ethereum Reality:**

- **Manual execution** - users must call refund functions
- **No built-in automation** for timelock expiration
- **User responsibility** to monitor and act

**ICP Reality:**

- **Canister timers** - automated scheduled tasks
- **Automatic refunds** when timelocks expire
- **Better UX** - no manual intervention required

**Impact on Requirements:**

- Automated timelock handling
- Enhanced recovery mechanisms
