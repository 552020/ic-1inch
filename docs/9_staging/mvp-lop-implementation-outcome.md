## Functional Outcomes

### **Order Management Capabilities**

#### **Order Creation**

```rust
// Expected functionality
create_order(
    receiver: Principal,
    maker_asset: Principal,    // ICRC token canister ID
    taker_asset: Principal,    // ICRC token canister ID
    making_amount: u64,
    taking_amount: u64,
    expiration: u64,
    allowed_taker: Option<Principal>
) -> Result<OrderId, OrderError>

// Success criteria:
✅ Validates all input parameters comprehensively
✅ Checks maker's token balance before order creation
✅ Stores order on-chain with zero gas cost to user
✅ Returns unique OrderId for tracking
✅ Completes in <100ms average response time
```

#### **Order Discovery**

```rust
// Expected functionality
get_active_orders() -> Vec<Order>
get_order(order_id: OrderId) -> Option<Order>
get_orders_by_maker(maker: Principal) -> Vec<Order>
get_orders_by_asset_pair(maker_asset: Principal, taker_asset: Principal) -> Vec<Order>

// Success criteria:
✅ Returns only active orders (not filled/cancelled/expired)
✅ Real-time data without caching inconsistencies
✅ Efficient queries supporting 1000+ concurrent orders
✅ Pagination support for large result sets

✅ Validates taker balance and order restrictions
✅ Updates order state to prevent double-spending
✅ Completes full execution in <1 second including token transfers
✅ Handles ICRC-1 transfer errors gracefully
```

#### **Order Management**
