# Base Sepolia Token Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the token availability on Base Sepolia testnet and explains why our initial testing approach with DAI tokens failed.

## Key Discovery

**The DAI token at address `0x50c5725949A6F0c72E6C4a641F24049A917DB0Cb` does not exist on Base Sepolia.**

This explains why our ERC20 testing scripts were failing with "contract does not exist" errors.

## Available Tokens on Base Sepolia

| Token    | Status           | Address                                      | Notes                       |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **USDC** | ✅ Available     | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` | Official Circle deployment  |
| **DAI**  | ❌ Not Available | N/A                                          | No standard DAI deployment  |
| **WETH** | ❌ Not Available | N/A                                          | No official WETH deployment |

## Why Our Original Scripts Worked

The original `cross-chain-swap` scripts worked because they were designed for:

1. **Local Development**: Using mock tokens deployed locally
2. **ETH Testing**: Native ETH transfers (no approvals needed)
3. **Simple Token Contracts**: Mock ERC20 tokens with basic implementations
4. **Test Environment**: No real network constraints

## Why Real ERC20 Tokens Fail

When testing with real ERC20 tokens on Base Sepolia, we encounter:

1. **Token Existence**: Token contracts must actually exist
2. **Token Approvals**: ERC20 requires `approve()` before `transferFrom()`
3. **Token Balances**: Users must have sufficient token balance
4. **Network Constraints**: Real network limitations vs local testing
5. **Token Economics**: Real tokens have security checks and economic constraints

## Current Testing Block

- **Fork Block**: `29160930`
- **Status**: Slightly ahead of explorer's latest block (~29159655)
- **Implication**: No tokens deployed after this block are available in our tests

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Available USDC

```solidity
// Use USDC instead of DAI
address public constant USDC_TOKEN = 0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e;
```

### Option 2: Deploy Mock Tokens

Deploy our own test ERC20 tokens to Base Sepolia for testing.

### Option 3: Fork Mainnet

Fork Ethereum mainnet to get access to real DAI/WETH tokens.

### Option 4: Use More Recent Fork

Update to a more recent fork block if tokens were deployed later.

## Impact on Our Testing

This discovery explains:

1. **Why `TestERC20EscrowDeployed.s.sol` failed**: DAI token doesn't exist
2. **Why address computation works**: It's purely mathematical, doesn't need real tokens
3. **Why original scripts worked**: They used mock tokens and ETH

## Next Steps

1. **Update test scripts** to use USDC instead of DAI
2. **Create mock token deployment scripts** for comprehensive testing
3. **Update documentation** to reflect real token availability
4. **Consider mainnet forking** for full token ecosystem testing

## Conclusion

The key insight is that **we were trying to test with tokens that don't exist**. The original scripts worked with ETH and mock tokens, but real ERC20 tokens on Base Sepolia require:

1. **Existing token contracts**
2. **Proper token approvals**
3. **Sufficient token balances**
4. **Real network considerations**

This explains the fundamental difference between local development testing and production-like testing on real testnets.
