# F.A.Q.

## âœ… Is 1inch a DEX?

**Yes and no.** 1inch is **not a traditional single DEX** like Uniswap or Curve. Instead, it's primarily a **DEX aggregator** that finds the best trade routes across many decentralized exchanges.

- It **aggregates liquidity** from multiple DEXs (like Uniswap, Curve, SushiSwap, Bancor, and more) to optimize trade prices and reduce slippage, fees, and failed trades([CoinMarketCap][1]).

- It also offers a native **Liquidity Protocol (originally Mooniswap)**â€”a capital-efficient AMM designed to counter front-running and serve as its own liquidity source([Komodo Platform][2]).

- That means 1inch functions both as an **aggregator** (routing trades across other DEXs) and as a **DEX platform** in itself, though its primary value lies in aggregation([Shrimpy Academy][3]).

| Aggregator (primary function)     | Routes trades across multiple DEXs to find best prices      |
| DEX platform (secondary function) | Operates its own AMM and limit-order protocols              |
| Tools                             | Limit Order Protocol, Liquidity Protocol, Fusion+, etc.     |
| Benefit                           | Deeper liquidity and better rates than most standalone DEXs |

## ðŸ§¾ Sources Supporting This

- 1inch is often described as a **DEX aggregator**â€”scanning many platforms to deliver the best swap rate([CoinMarketCap][4], [Gemini][5], [1inch Network][6], [1inch web app][7]).
- It is also part of a suite of DeFi protocols (Aggregation Protocol, Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, Fusion+, Wallet, etc.)([1inch Network][6]).
- 1inchâ€™s own Liquidity Protocol (formerly Mooniswap) acts as an AMM, though it has less total value locked than market leaders([Shrimpy Academy][3]).

### âœ… Final Answer

**1inch is primarily a decentralized exchange aggregator**â€”its core mission is to _route trades across multiple DEXs_ to secure optimal prices and liquidity. It also maintains its own AMM and exchange infrastructure, but aggregation remains its defining strength.

Let me know if you'd like to dive into any of its protocols or how Fusion+ factors in!

Yes â€” those are the **core services** of the 1inch Network. Based on official sources, 1inch offers:

---

## ðŸ§© Main Protocols of 1inch

### 1. **Aggregation Protocol**

- Aggregates liquidity from **hundreds of DEXs and liquidity sources** across multiple chains for optimal swap routing and minimized slippage.([1inch Network][1])

### 2. **Limit Order Protocol**

- Enables users to create **limit orders off-chain**, setting target price or execution windows. The protocol executes these trades when criteria are met, offering flexible and gas-efficient options.([IQ.wiki][2])

### 3. **Liquidity Protocol (AMM)**

- A smart-contractâ€“based AMMâ€”formerly known as Mooniswapâ€”that provides **capital-efficient liquidity pools** and anti-front-running features for liquidity providers.([1inch Network][3])

### 4. **Fusion+ (or Fusion)**

- An **intent-based, cross-chain swap system** that uses HTLC-based atomic swaps and gasless execution. Users sign an intent, and **resolvers** compete via Dutch auction to fulfill itâ€”providing MEV protection and cross-chain execution with no user gas cost.([1inch Network][4])
