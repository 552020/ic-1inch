## Overview

### What is This Repository?

The `cross-chain-swap` repository contains the **smart contract backend** for 1inch's Fusion atomic swap protocol. It's specifically for **Fusion** (not Fusion+) and implements cross-chain atomic swaps between EVM-compatible chains.

## Architecture Analysis

### Core Components

1. **EscrowSrc**: Holds user's tokens on the source chain
2. **EscrowDst**: Holds resolver's tokens on the destination chain
3. **EscrowFactory**: Creates escrow proxy contracts for each swap
4. **Resolver Network**: Off-chain entities that execute swaps competitively

## Design Patterns

### 1. Factory Pattern + Proxy Pattern Combined

The architecture uses both patterns together for maximum efficiency:

#### Factory Pattern

- `EscrowFactory` creates contracts for each swap
- Provides centralized creation and management
- Ensures standardization across all escrows

#### Proxy Pattern

- Each swap gets a lightweight proxy contract (~50 bytes)
- All proxies delegate to shared implementation contracts
- Massive gas savings compared to deploying full contracts

```solidity
// Factory creates implementations ONCE per chain
ESCROW_SRC_IMPLEMENTATION = address(new EscrowSrc(rescueDelaySrc, accessToken));
ESCROW_DST_IMPLEMENTATION = address(new EscrowDst(rescueDelayDst, accessToken));

// Factory creates proxies for EACH swap
function _deployEscrow(bytes32 salt, uint256 value, address implementation) internal virtual returns (address escrow) {
    escrow = implementation.cloneDeterministic(salt, value);  // Creates proxy
}
```

### 2. Proxy Contract Explanation

A **proxy contract** is like an API endpoint that forwards requests:

#### What is a Proxy?

- An intermediary that **stands in for** something else
- **Forwards calls** to the real implementation
- **Has its own storage** but shares logic

#### Real-World Analogy

- **Proxy** = Receptionist at a company
- **Implementation** = Employee who does the work
- **User** = Client making requests

#### In Fusion's Context

```
User → Proxy Contract → Implementation Contract
  ↓         ↓              ↓
"withdraw" → "withdraw" → [Complex withdrawal logic]
  ↓         ↓              ↓
Result ← Result ← Result
```

### 3. Deterministic Addresses

```solidity
// Can compute escrow address before deployment
function addressOfEscrowSrc(IBaseEscrow.Immutables calldata immutables) external view returns (address) {
    return Create2.computeAddress(immutables.hash(), _PROXY_SRC_BYTECODE_HASH);
}
```

Benefits:

- **Pre-funding**: Send tokens before deployment
- **Predictability**: Know address in advance
- **Gas efficiency**: Deploy only when needed

## Cross-Chain Communication

### Key Finding: No Direct Communication Between Escrows

The escrows **do NOT communicate directly**. Instead:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   CHAIN A       │    │   CHAIN B       │
│                 │    │                 │
│ EscrowSrc       │    │ EscrowDst       │
│                 │    │                 │
└─────────┬───────┘    └─────────┬───────┘
          │                       │
          │                       │
          └─────────┬─────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
            ┌─────────────────┐
            │    RESOLVER     │
            │  (Off-chain)    │
            │                 │
            │ • Coordinates   │
            │ • Manages       │
            │ • Distributes   │
            │   secrets       │
            └─────────────────┘
```

### Communication Flow

1. **Resolver wins auction** to execute swap _(auction logic is external to this repo)_
2. **Resolver deploys EscrowSrc** on Chain A
3. **Resolver deploys EscrowDst** on Chain B
4. **Resolver receives secret** from user
5. **Resolver calls both escrows** with the same secret

> **Note**: The auction mechanism is **NOT implemented in this repository**. It's handled by the Limit Order Protocol and off-chain resolver infrastructure.

### No Bridge Contract in This Repo

**There is NO cross-chain bridge** in this repository. The "bridge" is the **off-chain resolver network** that:

- Operates independently on each chain
- Uses the same order intent on both chains
- Coordinates withdrawals through shared secrets

## Implementation for Other Chains

### EVM to EVM Chains

**You can use this repo directly!**

#### Deployment Strategy

1. **Deploy this repo on Chain A** (all contracts)
2. **Deploy this repo on Chain B** (all contracts)
3. **Build an off-chain resolver** to coordinate
4. **Use same order parameters** on both chains

#### Evidence

The `deployments/` directory shows this pattern:

- `mainnet/`, `polygon/`, `arbitrum/`, `optimism/`, etc.
- Same contracts deployed on different chains

### EVM to Non-EVM (e.g., ICP)

**You have partial code reuse:**

#### What You Have (~30-40%)

- ✅ **EVM side contracts** (complete)
- ✅ **Design patterns** (reusable concepts)
- ✅ **Timelock logic** (adaptable)
- ✅ **Factory pattern** (adaptable)

#### What You Need to Build (~60-70%)

- ❌ **Non-EVM smart contracts** (e.g., ICP canisters in Rust)
- ❌ **Address format handling** (EVM vs ICP addresses)
- ❌ **Cross-chain bridge/resolver** (coordinate between different architectures)
- ❌ **Token standards integration** (different token standards)

## Key Findings

### 1. Fusion vs Basic Atomic Swaps

**Fusion is much more advanced than basic atomic swaps:**

| Feature       | Basic Atomic Swap           | Fusion                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Execution     | Direct peer-to-peer         | Competitive resolver network                  |
| Availability  | Both parties must be online | Resolvers compete 24/7                        |
| Partial fills | All-or-nothing              | Sophisticated partial fills with Merkle trees |
| Integration   | Manual                      | Integrates with Limit Order Protocol          |
| Incentives    | No economic incentives      | Safety deposits & competitive fees            |
| Scalability   | Limited                     | Highly scalable                               |

### 2. Fusion vs Fusion+

- **Fusion** (this repo): Escrow-based atomic swaps with resolver network
- **Fusion+**: Likely more advanced with native cross-chain aggregation and enhanced features
- Both are cross-chain, but Fusion+ is probably more sophisticated

### 3. Resolver vs Relayer

**They are different entities:**

- **Relayer**: Platform provider (like 1inch) - deploys infrastructure, takes platform fees
- **Resolver**: Independent operator - competes to execute swaps, takes execution fees

### 4. Address Handling

**For EVM chains**: Same address works on all chains (EVM compatibility)

```
Maker Address: 0x1234...5678
├── Ethereum: 0x1234...5678
├── Polygon: 0x1234...5678
├── Arbitrum: 0x1234...5678
└── BSC: 0x1234...5678
```

### 5. Repository Scope

**This repository is ONLY the smart contract backend:**

- ❌ No frontend UI
- ❌ No resolver network implementation
- ❌ No cross-chain bridge contracts
- ❌ No order management system
- ✅ Only the core escrow smart contracts

## Conclusion

The 1inch Fusion atomic swap protocol is a sophisticated system that transforms basic atomic swaps into a competitive, scalable cross-chain trading infrastructure. The smart contracts in this repository provide the foundational escrow mechanisms, while the complete system relies on external resolver networks and frontend interfaces to deliver the full user experience.

For EVM-to-EVM implementations, this repository provides a complete foundation that can be deployed across multiple chains. For non-EVM integrations, the design patterns and concepts are valuable, but significant additional development is required.
