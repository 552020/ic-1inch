A 1inch Fusion+ order is an intent-based atomic cross-chain swap that uses Dutch auctions and automated execution without relying on a centralized custodian.
The process involves a maker creating and signing the order, then resolvers competing in a Dutch auction to fill it across three main phases: Announcement (Dutch auction), Deposit (escrow setup), and Withdrawal (completion).
