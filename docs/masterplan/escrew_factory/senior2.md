Your questions about cross-chain atomic swaps, HTLCs, and atomicity between ICP and EVM are highly relevant and well-structured. Here’s what the knowledge sources reveal, with a focus on implementation details, critical failure modes, and best practices for your MVP:

---

## 1. **HTLC Implementation Pattern for ICP ↔ EVM Swaps**

- **HTLCs must be created on both chains** (ICP and EVM), each locking the respective asset with the same hashlock and coordinated timelocks.
- **Coordination should be managed by an ICP canister** acting as the orderbook and state machine, ensuring both escrows are created with matching parameters and tracking their state transitions.
- **Threshold ECDSA** can be used to deterministically derive EVM addresses controlled by the ICP canister, allowing the canister to create and sign EVM transactions directly ([Threshold ECDSA](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa), [Ethereum Integration](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/ethereum/overview)).

---

## 2. **Achieving "Virtual Atomicity"**

- **True atomicity is not possible** due to the independent nature of blockchains. The best you can achieve is “virtual atomicity” by:
  - Coordinating all state transitions through the ICP canister.
  - Using protocol-level guarantees and careful sequencing (e.g., only revealing the secret after both escrows are confirmed).
  - Implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for partial failures ([Chain Fusion security](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/overview#how-does-it-work-and-why-is-it-secure)).

---

## 3. **Critical Failure Points to Handle**

- **Partial escrow creation:** One escrow succeeds, the other fails (e.g., ICP succeeds, EVM fails due to gas or network issues).
- **Secret revelation mismatch:** Secret is revealed on one chain but not the other, leading to potential loss or lockup of funds.
- **Timelock misalignment:** Different finality times or network delays cause one timelock to expire before the other, risking funds.
- **Chain reorgs or network partitions:** Can cause state inconsistencies or missed events.
- **Threshold ECDSA failures:** If the canister cannot sign EVM transactions due to threshold ECDSA issues, the swap may stall.

---

## 4. **Secret Management and Revelation**

- **Secret should be generated and managed by the ICP canister** (or a trusted party), then distributed to both escrows.
- **Revelation should be coordinated**: Only reveal the secret after both escrows are confirmed and active.
- **Fallbacks:** If revelation fails on one chain, implement a recovery path (e.g., allow refund after timelock expiry).

---

## 5. **Optimal State Machine for Cross-Chain HTLC Coordination**

- Use a state machine in the ICP canister to track:
  - `Pending` → `EscrowsCreated` → `Active` → `SecretRevealed` → `Completed`/`Expired`/`Failed`
- **State transitions should be triggered by on-chain events** (escrow creation, secret revelation, withdrawal, expiry).
- **Consistency:** The ICP canister should be the source of truth and coordinate all transitions.

---

## 6. **Threshold ECDSA Integration**

- **Use threshold ECDSA to derive deterministic EVM addresses** for escrows, based on order hash or other unique parameters.
- **Ensure the same address is used for HTLC creation** on EVM, and that the canister can sign transactions for it.
- **Handle ECDSA failures** by implementing retries and monitoring for signature generation issues ([Threshold ECDSA](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa)).

---

## 7. **Chain Fusion Patterns for HTLC Coordination**

- **Chain Fusion enables ICP canisters to interact with EVM chains** via the EVM RPC canister, allowing creation and management of EVM escrows from ICP ([Chain Fusion overview](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/overview#how-does-it-work-and-why-is-it-secure), [EVM RPC canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/ethereum/evm-rpc/evm-rpc-canister)).
- **Coordinate all cross-chain actions through the ICP canister** for maximum reliability and auditability.

---

## 8. **Monitoring and Recovery Mechanisms**

- **Monitor all on-chain events** (escrow creation, secret revelation, withdrawals, expiries) on both chains.
- **Implement automatic retries** for failed transactions (e.g., EVM transaction fails due to gas).
- **Alert users on failures** and provide clear recovery paths (e.g., refunds after timelock expiry).
- **Handle network partitions and chain reorganizations** by waiting for sufficient confirmations and using conservative timelocks.

---

## **MVP Focus: Critical Implementation Details**

- **Robust coordination logic in the ICP canister**: This is your single source of truth and coordinator for all cross-chain actions.
- **Consistent hashlock and timelock parameters**: Ensure both escrows use the same values.
- **Timelock buffer**: Set EVM timelock > ICP timelock + buffer to account for slower EVM finality.
- **Error handling**: Detect and recover from partial failures, and provide clear user feedback.
- **Threshold ECDSA monitoring**: Ensure the canister can always sign EVM transactions when needed.

---

## **Most Common Failure Modes**

- Escrow creation succeeds on one chain but fails on the other.
- Secret is revealed on one chain but not the other.
- Timelock expires on one chain before the other due to network delays.
- Threshold ECDSA signing fails or is delayed.
- Chain Fusion RPC calls fail or time out.

**In summary:**  
Focus your MVP on robust coordination, consistent parameters, and clear error/recovery paths. Use the ICP canister as the orchestrator, leverage threshold ECDSA for deterministic EVM addresses, and use Chain Fusion for cross-chain operations. Always account for the fundamental limits of cross-chain atomicity and design your state machine and error handling accordingly ([Chain Fusion security](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/chain-fusion/overview#how-does-it-work-and-why-is-it-secure), [Threshold ECDSA](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa)).
