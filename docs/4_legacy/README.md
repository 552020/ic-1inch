### EVM Development

- **evm/** - Our first attempt at building the EVM side of cross-chain Fusion+ swaps (simplified "mechanical turk" version)
  - `FusionEscrow.sol` - Simplified escrow contract for ICP-ETH swaps
  - `TestTokens.sol` - Test token contracts
  - TypeScript tests and Hardhat configuration
- **Cross-chain-swap repository analysis** - Our first attempt at understanding and implementing the EVM side of cross-chain swaps
- **Deployment guides and scripts** - Initial deployment attempts and configurations
- **Technical troubleshooting** - Issues encountered during early development

## Note

These documents represent our learning process and early development attempts. The current implementation has evolved significantly from these first attempts, but they are preserved for reference and to show the development progression.
